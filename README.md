UFPR Data Hackathon Project

This project was developed to improve the visibility and accessibility of data from UFPR’s general evaluation forms for courses and subjects. Previously, the data was handled and viewed in simple XLSX spreadsheets. The objective of this project is to provide a clearer, more structured, and statistically oriented way to explore these datasets.

How to Run the Project

Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. To check this, open a terminal and run:
python --version
(Python 3.13.9 is recommended, as it was used during development.)

Install the required dependencies. With a terminal open in the project directory (where the requirements.txt file is located), run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application. Since the project uses Streamlit, open a terminal in the folder containing app.py and execute:
python -m streamlit run app.py
This will automatically open the system in your browser.
