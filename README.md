# UFPR DATA HACKATHON PROJECT
This project was developed to improve the visibility of data from UFPR’s general evaluation forms for subjects and courses. Previously, these datasets were handled and visualized in simpler XLSX files. The idea was to create a more organized and statistically oriented way to explore this information than traditional spreadsheets.

Access the deployed application:
https://hackathonufpr.streamlit.app/

## Technologies:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Altair

## How to run the project:
1. First, ensure that Python is installed on your machine. To verify, open the terminal and type **python --version** (We recommend version 3.13.9, which was used during development).
2. Install the project dependencies. Open the terminal in the folder containing the project files (specifically the requirements.txt) and type **pip install -r requirements.txt**.
3. Run the project. The system currently runs via Streamlit, so open the terminal in the directory where app.py is located and type **python -m streamlit run app.py**. A browser tab will automatically open with the application running.
